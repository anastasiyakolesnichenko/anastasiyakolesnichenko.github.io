  <h3> Hi, my name is Anastasiya, and I am from Siberia, Russia. I moved to New York three years ago with my heart and mind open to exploring and with my horse by my side, who is always there for me, during my ups and downs. I've
been to 52 countries and am planning on visiting every single country in the world. </h3>
