			 <h1> Volunteering is an important part of my life </h1>


			<p>I’ve been volunteering for as long as I can remember. It all started with my family taking children from the orphanages shopping on Christmas Eve. They could choose whatever they wanted, and I loved spending my time paying attention to those who needed it the most. I clearly remember the happiness in those kids’ eyes. I knew that for them going shopping as an activity mattered more than actually buying stuff. Those kids, they were not coming from poverty, they had pretty much everything they wanted in an orphanage. However, what they did not have was the freedom of the choice. </p>


	<p>I grew up but my desire for helping children stayed with me. I worked in a few summer camps, organized concerts for disabled children and learned to teach horseback riding as a therapeutic or rehabilitative treatment.</p>

	<p>One of the most significant volunteer works that I’ve done was teaching arts and crafts in a school in Harlem, New York. As a part of Citizen Schools project, I have been teaching 6 graders a Maker Movement workshop. At the end of the semester, we have presented our works at the final WOW show. Kids were super excited about their project. And right before the holidays I asked them to leave me a note with some things that they likes and disliked about apprenticeship. I received notes such as <q>I loved this apprenticeship, because Miss Anastasiya made me notice you can make anything out of anything, like you can make a cape and accessories out of a garbage bad and tape</q> and <q>What I likes was that we had fun and what I dod not like is we only had it once a week.</q></p>
